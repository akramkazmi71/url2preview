# url2preview (Link Preview)

  How this works:

  Just copy your url and past it into the text field and click "Show Preview". Then it post the url 
  data into PHP that does all the work to  the source code of the url found. Once the source code of 
  the url is obtained, PHP function "file_get_contents()" and regular expressions begin to seek out 
  and taking relevant information on it.
